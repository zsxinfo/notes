# preface

Every moment in bussiness happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them.

Of course, it's easier to copy a model than make something new. Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.

Unless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the future no matter how big their profits remain today. What happens when we've gained everything to be had from fine-tuning the old lines of business that we've innherited? Unlikely as it sounds, the answer threatens to be far worse than the crisis of 2008. Today's "best practices" lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried.

In a world of gigantic 巨大 administractive bureaucracies 行政官僚体系 both public and private, searching for a new path might seem like hoping for a miracle. Actually, if American business is going to succeed, we are going to need hundreds, or even thousands, of miracles. This would be depressing but for one crucial fact: humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles *technology*.

Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do *more with less*, ratcheting up 升级 our fundamental capabilities to a higher level. Other animals are instinctively driven to build things like dams 大坝 or honeycombs, 蜂巢 but we are the only ones that can invent new things and better ways of making them. Humans don't decide what to build by making choices from some cosmic 宇宙的 catalog 目录 of options given in advance; instead, by creating new technologies, we rewrite the plan of the world. These are the kind of elementary truths we teach to second graders, but they are easy to forget in a world where so much of what we do is repeat what has been done before.

*Zero to One* is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on everything I've learned directly as a co-founder of PayPal adn Palantir and then an investor  in hundreds of starups, including Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have noticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this book offers no formula for success. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily cannot exist; because evety innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe 开药方 指示 in concrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.

first principles: priciples that are basic or self-evident.

第一原则：基本原则；不证自明、不言而喻的原则

This book stems from a course about starups that I taught at Stanford in 2012. College students can become extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never learn what to do with those skills in the wider world. My primary goal in teaching the class was to help my students see beyond the tracks laid down by academic specialties to the broader future that is theirs to create. One of those students, Blake Masters, took detailed class notes, which circulated far beyond the campus, and in *Zero to One* I've worked with him to revise 修订 the notes for a wider audience. There's no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon Valley.

# 1. The challenge of the future

Whenever I interview someone for a job, I like to ask this question: " What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

This question sounds easy because it's straightforward. Actually, it's hard to answer. It's intellectually difficult because the knowledge that evetyone is taught in school is by definition agreed upon. And it's psychologically 心理学上 difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something she knows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.

Most commonly, I hear answers like the following:

"Our educational system is broken and urgently 急切的 needs to be fixed."

“American is exceptional.异常 独特 非凡 杰出"

"There is no God."

Those are bad answers. The first and the second statements might be true, but many peoplel already agree with them. The third statement simply takes one side in a familiar debate. A good answer takes the following form: "Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x." I'll give my own answer later in this chapter.

What does this contrarian 采取相反态度的 逆向思维的 question have to do with the future?  In the most minimal sense 在最微小的意义上, the future is simply the set fo all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive 与众不同的 有特色的 and important isn't that it hasn't happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today. In this sense, if nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100 years away. If things change radically in the next decade, then the future is nearly at hand. No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it's going to be different, and it must be rooted in today's world. Most answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.
